[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmeyer/stl_io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmeyer/stl_io)

stl_io is crate for reading and writing [STL (STereoLithography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) files. It can read both, binary and ascii STL in a safe manner. Writing is limited to binary STL, which is more compact anyway.
